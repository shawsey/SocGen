# SocGen

SocGen right now is a little quarantine project for myself to pick up Javascript development. The idea of SocGEN, or the Social Engineering Generator, is to randomly generate a detailed identity on a click. Using the list of most common names, combined with assorted job fields, locations, and background, it can quickly scaffold an identity on the go.
